            In the quest of finding products that will give us that everlasting glow, we have completely forgotten about the natural ingredients our grandmothers used to keep their skin plump and youthful. So, in memory of that we’ve come up with some amazing DIYs using natural and complementary ingredients for all skin types and concerns. Milk comes with a variety of benefits that are not only dietary

                    But also great for our skin. Why resort to beauty products when we can use this super popular, calcium enriched ingredient topically? The lactic acid present in milk gently exfoliates the skin by swapping out the old dead skin cells for new. Infusing our skin with milk will naturally keep our skin soft and if you use it as a cleanser, it will help remove all the dirt and impurities revealing glowing skin.

                    Enriched with Vitamin A, milk has the potential to eliminate free radicals responsible for premature ageing and pigmentation. It also rejuvenates the skin by improving it’s texture and moisture levels. The health and beauty benefits and properties of aloe vera are well known to all as it has been a staple ingredient in so many skin products and regimes. For all those who have oily skin, aloe vera has been a go-to moisturizer as it hydrates the skin while keeping it non-greasy. It’s acne busting properties

                    Also calm down irritated and acne-prone skin. It’s also typically used on skin inflamed due to UV exposure. Its antimicrobial properties also work towards reducing the appearance of stretch marks over a period of time. Despite many new ingredients in the market, aloe vera has stuck around for a reason and we should continue reaping its benefits. With pollution having such a negative impact on our skin on a daily basis, we’re constantly looking for ways to revive our skin. Drinking at least 2-3 litres of water on a daily basis

                    Is the key to keep your skin super healthy. The more hydrated you stay, the lesser the chances of your skin wrinkling. Increasing your water intake will help flush out all the toxins from the body which leads to reduced puffiness and even complexion. Another simple solution to great skin lies in your freezer, Ice. Skin icing is another technique that enhances penetration of the products applied onto the face. Just take an ice-cube and gently go all around the parts of your face in circular motions.

                    A dose of chill can help reduce the appearance of pores, banish under eye bags and sun tan as well. Follow up with a moisturizer and sunscreen for best results. The Greeks have been boosting their skin with the goodness of yogurt for years now. So taking some inspiration from them, eating yogurt regularly or mixing it with a few complementary ingredients and applying it on our face works wonders for our skin too. This all-round multi-tasker will help moisturize your skin, fight acne, reduce sun tan and pigmentation.

                    It also diminishes the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, etc. Ingredients like oats, cocoa powder, honey, bentonite clay, fruits, etc. work in tandem with the properties of yogurt to make your skin healthier. Oily skin is something that most women in our country deal with on a daily basis. One common ingredient that you can keep handy is rosewater. It can be used as a facial mist to rehydrate the face during the course of the day or even add it to one of your DIYs

                    To help fight acne and control sebum production. The antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties of this concoction helps balance out the pH levels of your skin and eases redness. If you’re suffering from any razor burns on any part of your body, you can apply some rose water mixed with aloe vera gel on the affected area. All these ingredients are very popular, available in our kitchen closet at all times and have been age-old techniques to achieve radiant skin.

                    Cleansing your face is very important as this will allow your pores to breathe and absorb your toners and serums much more effectively use a gentle cleanser during the day and switch to double cleansing at night. Your night cleansing routine should always start with breaking down your makeup with a face oil or an oil based cleanser which by the way is the most nourishing way to remove your makeup. Or you can just use a makeup remover of your choice.

                    he very first thing you apply after cleansing your skin thoroughly is a toner. Cleansing opens up the pores and so applying toners will not only tighten the pores but will also remove any impurities left after cleansing and balance the oils of your skin. Its watery consistency

                    Gets easily absorbed into the skin instantly reviving it. But its important to use one that's specific to your skin type. The best way to use a toner is to take some in your hands and gently press it all over your skin and let it sink in. You should ideally apply your spot treatments at night because that's exactly when our skin is working super hard to revive itself and boost cell regeneration. So if you have a sudden breakout and want to spot treat it, the right way to deal with

                <p>
                    Serums are essentially just shots of extremely concentrated nutrients, hydrators and anti oxidants that penetrate deep into your skin. You can actually even pick 2 to 3 serums to help you target your specific skincare issues like wrinkles, dry skin, redness etc. The formula contains bio active ingredients and is made of smaller molecules that gets absorbed quickly and is

                    Super lightweight. Vitamin C serums are the most common ones that work on pigmentation and hydrating your skin. If you're above 30 years old, using hyaluronic infused serums over your everyday serum is also a must. People often neglect serums and skip adding them in their everyday routines but I honestly think that theyre the actual heavy lifters amongst all the skincare products.

                    Such as dark circles, crows feet and even puffiness. Eye creams are thinner and lighter than our face creams and hence should be applied before we go in with a moisturiser as this may help with the better absorption of the product. They depuff and give your eyes that extra boost of hydration making you look fresh and well rested overnight.

                    Everyone needs a moisturizer no matter what your skin type is. Your moisturizer not only does the job of hydrating your skin but also helps trap in all the products underneath it to make sure the ingredients are even more effective.

                    Make sure that you leave the areas where you've used a spot treatment so that the ingredients of both the products dont end up interfering with each other. Please use separate day and night creams for best results.

                    you're still left with some sunscreen to apply. Remember this is the most important step as it will protect your skin from the harmful UV rays and will also act as a protective barrier against dust and pollution. But wait for a full 5 minutes before you

                <p>
                    Apply your sunscreen. During night time simply switch this step up by applying a lip balm as your lips have thin skin too and need constant hydration. Our skin is beautifully engineered but needs a lot of care, maintenance and discipline on a regular basis to keep it glowing and healthy. So memories these steps and learn this routine to maintain gorgeous skin at all times.
